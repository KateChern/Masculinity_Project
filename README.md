# Masculinity_Project
K-Means Clustering 

In this project, we was investigating the way people think about masculinity by applying the KMeans algorithm to data from FiveThirtyEight.
FiveThirtyEight is a popular website known for their use of statistical analysis in many of their stories.


In this project I was working with Unsupervised machine learning algorithm K-Means Clustering in Python 3, using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn.
